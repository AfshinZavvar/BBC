        <p>Silverstone first hosted the British Grand Prix in 1950 and has been the event's permanent home since 1987.</p>
        <p>Formula 1 chief Bernie Ecclestone told ITV News: "If they want to activate a break clause, there is nothing we can do.</p>

        <p>Three-time world champion Sir Jackie Stewart added: "I think it's a credible threat, not impossible for it to happen. I would be very sad if it did.</p>
