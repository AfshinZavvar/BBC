Sample news portal website using Sitecore 8.2,ASP.NET MVC and Unicorn

20 Jan 2017:
  I've recently started to learn Sitecore 8 using MVC and tried to impelement a sample news portal, called BBC
  
  Project has a custom pipeline so you should copy "Sitecore.ContentSearch.Lucene.Index.News.config"
  From:  [project path]\App_Config\Include
  To:  C:\inetpub\wwwroot\[Your Website name]\Website\App_Config\Include

  Due to I've changed unicorn.config file, all database seralized items will be saved in a absoulte path ("D:\BBC\Unicorn"). 
  

  Please feel free to join and improve!
